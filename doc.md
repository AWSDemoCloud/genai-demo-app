## Git Diff Summary

### 1. Description of Changes and Their Importance

In the `app/redundant.js` file, a single line of code has been modified in the `isEven` function. The change is:

- The `else` branch of the conditional statement in the `isEven` function now returns `true` instead of `false`. This change fixes a logical error in the function, ensuring that it correctly determines whether a number is even or not.

This change is important because it corrects a bug in the `isEven` function, which previously returned an incorrect result for odd numbers.

### 2. Potential Issues or Improvements

While the change addresses the logical error in the `isEven` function, there are a few potential improvements that could be made:

- The function could be simplified by returning the expression `n % 2 === 0` directly, eliminating the need for an `if` statement.
- Error handling could be added to handle cases where the input is not a number.
- Unit tests could be added to ensure the correct behavior of the function and prevent regressions in the future.
